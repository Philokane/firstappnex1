**Most favourite tasks**

1. **Write and maintain support articles and docs pages**

    It is vital that good internal and external documentation is maintained. This should be easy to read and understand, up-to-date and answer the questions an end-user may have, while also sign-posting to where other information can be found for deeper knowlefge or further assistance.

    Working as part of a team is a vital part of ensuring that the business runs smoothly - managing time-off coverage ensures that the team is

3. **Manage a support team**

    For me managing a support team is about understanding the goals and aims of the business and how the team can better meet these goals. I use my knowledge as a support team member as well as the technical tasks performed by the support team to understand the goals of the team, as well as the skills of each team-member, and how this can be utilised to improve the running of the business.

4. **Help train and onboard new support teammates**

    Sharing my knowledge to new team-members is an important part of my role. I maintain strong personal documentation that I am able to share among team-members and I ensure those around me have the information they need to be great at their job.

5. **Respond to queries on Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News and other 3rd party sites**

    It is important that the company keeps in touch with the developer community and is able to see where the users are in order to fully understand the user-base as well as improving the services and products offered. I am comfortable communicating in these spaces as I see the importance of being in the spaces that our users and customers are.

Least Favourite tasks

1. **Find and recruit teammates for the support team**

2. **Work with 3rd party partners to track down a tricky situation for a joint customer**

    While this will take a lot of work, I am more comfortable working through a number of issues in order to assist a number of users and customers over spending a long time on a single issue.

3. **Dig through logs to troubleshoot a customer's broken project**

    When I get bogged down on an issue that I’m stuck on, I will often spend more time than necessary, which can lead to other work or projects being neglected. In order to ensure this does not happen I will set timers and block time on my calendar. However, due to the requirement to be fully aware of time while working such a task, I will mark this as something that would not be a preference.

4. **Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case**

    I’m not comfortable recording myself on video, however I am always happy to demonstrate how a task is performed or how to use a specific feature in-person or on a Zoom call.

5. **Help resolve billing issues for customers**

    I’m comfortable working technical issues rather than billing concerns. Whenever these issues arise, I will do what I can in order to understand the customer’s use-case offer a good solution, however I will revert to the billing team for bill-specific issues,
